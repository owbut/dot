# BSPWM dotfiles
These are my dotfiles. Pretty simple, configuration paths are wack for a lot of programs because I change them, but it shouldn't effect you. Polybar configuration will be for my monitors and will be irrelevant to you, so tweak as you must. The sxhkd is weird too, the binds for multiple workspaces are weird because they are tuned to my liking and they might be weird for other monitor configurations so you can change it back to the default if you ever so wish.
